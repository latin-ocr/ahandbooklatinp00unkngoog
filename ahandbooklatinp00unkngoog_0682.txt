ODE XXV1.—This Ode is sn invocation ol the Mose, praying
hor to ‹lo honor to μ Aelius Lamia, a Roman os noble family, who
distinguished hirnsels in the war with the Cantabri 1t would ap-
pear that, at tho time it was written, the affairs os the Parthians were
occupyiltg a good deal os attention at Rornc, sinte Horace speaks os
himself as lhe only one who gave no hcecl to them. The circnm-
stances lhat rnay be supposed to he referred eo are to be gathercd
{rorh the following account, zn the year B⁴ C. 30, Phraates {Arsaces
xv.) being on the Parthian throne, ancl having hy his crnelties rnads
himself obnoxious to his subjects, Tiridates, like‘wise orie os the sarn-
ily of Arsacidae, was set np as a rival to Phraates, lant was defeated
ih his attempt to dsthrone him, ancl fied sor protectior. to Angmstns,
who was then in Syris, after the ‹leath os M. Antonius. Shnrtly
anerwnrds, however, the Parthians sncceedecl in getting ricl of their
iring, ancl Tiridates was called to the throne. 1n B. c⁴ ις, Phraares,
having obtained assistance froin the Scythians, returned and recov-
ered his kingdom, and Tiridates ssed to Angustus once more sor pro·
tectioris He was then in Spain. The assembling of the Scythiam
soree and the aiarm os Tiridates are evidently referred to here, and
the two seem ιο be associated. It is natural to infer, therefore, that
it was just hslore Tiridates flod from his kingdom, in iiic. 25, that
the Ode was composed.
