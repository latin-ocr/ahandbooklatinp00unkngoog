ered as n work of art, and as contributing to the interest
of the student, but sor the greater convenience os those
who may wish to finisli reading the author. The seleo
tions {roni Ovid nre nearly, though not exnetly, the same
as in other school editions pubiished in this country ,¹ all
os which are based on the edition of the Rev, C. Bradley,
publio—hed long ago in England. From Virgil, the ist, 3d,
