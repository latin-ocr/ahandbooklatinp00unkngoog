363 THE unz OF ovm.

The works of Ovirl up to the time of his erile have already heen
enumerated. To these aro io he added the five books of elegies
called Tristia, wrilten during the iirotsonr year-s os his hanishxneni,
and the four hooke oi Epistulae ex Panto, written subsequently, in rhe
same mensuro as ihc Μαῖα, and, like that work, inade np os descrip-
tione ofhie afflieied condition and petitions sor mereyi There is also
a eatirieal poen-i called liis, written in exile, and several other pienes,
whose genuineness is inore or less doubtful. Of the ewoive books os
the Foth, only six have coine rlown to ns, :ind some have thought
that only six were ever written⁴ The Mommsenio, which the poet
hnrnt on going inm exile. was complete in its plan, rhongh ir had noe
received its inst ronches, and copies or ii were already in the hands*
oisriende, through whom it was preserved

Ovid‘s eleganoe as his pvincipal distinction, it io only because his sue.

“His varioue eornpositions,” says another vniter, srorn whom we
have already quoted, “comprehend many pieees of uneullied purity
and grace, which are still the iirst pages of antiquiiy we put into the
handu o( our children, and among the last on which we rurn the retro-
speot of our own cloelining years ..... His amatory poenis were
principally the work oshis earlier years, and the maturity of hie powers
was devoted sedulously, nor with less selioity, to suhjects of wider
scope and higher iiiterest.”i
