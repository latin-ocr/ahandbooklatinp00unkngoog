THE SATIRES. Boea< II.

SATIRE V1.—1n this Satirey Horace dweiis upon tho incon-
venienccs osa town life and the delights ofthe ronntry, the sornisr as
connected with tha importnnity of people asking for his influenoo
wilh Maecenas, or sor insul-matium upon public affairs ns which he
knows nrnhing, though they will not believe it.

wnenever Horace ronches on matters pers-inni io himself. ho
does it with humor and feeling, He is also very skilsul ixl telling a
story or representing a dramntio tnhlonn. Tho sablo os the town and
cnuntxy meuse could hardly have been better toiri than it is here.

and the contrast between ι town and country life, are among his most
nat-nni ronrhos3 nno rho allusion to his intimaqr with Maecenas and
the envy it harl brought npon him, is mannged with deiicnoy towzrds
