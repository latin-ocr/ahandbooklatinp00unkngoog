1« isnrerelyaconjecture, though it is prohahle, that Virgilius re-
tired to his paternal sar-nn, and here he nray have written sorae οι the
small pieoes which are attlibuted tu him, the Culex, Cirts, Mantum,
and others¹ The desem ns Brutus and Cassius by Μ, Amullius and
Octavianus Caesar at Philippi, Β, c. 42. gave the suprenrc power to
the two victorious generals, and whcn Octavianus returrrcrl to ltaly,
he began to assign to his soldiors lautis which had been prornised
tlrenr sor tlrcir services But the solrliers could only hc provided with
land hy turning ont nrarry cs the occupiers, and the ncighhorhood or·
Crcrnoua anal Mantua was ane ns tlre districts in which the soltliers
wereplantcd, aud froin which the tornier pnssessors were disludged.
There is little evidence as to tlre circumstances under which Virgil
was deprived ol his property. itis sairl tlrat it was seizcd hy a yet-
crau nanred Claudius or Clodius; anrl tlrat Asinius Pollio, who was
then governor of Gallia Transpadana, atlvised Virgll to apply ιο Oc-
tavianus at Rorne tor the restitution os his land, aud that Octavianus
granted his request lt is supposed that virgil wrote the Eclogue
which stands first in our editions, to cornnnernorate his gratirudo ιο
Octavianus Caesar. Whether the poet was subsequently ‹listurhcd
in his possession and again restored, and whether he was not iirrnly
secured in his patrirnorrial sarira till aster the peace oi Brundusium, Β,
c⁴ 40. hetween Octavianus Caesar and M. Antonius, is a rnatter which
no extant authority is sufficient to detor-ruine.

Virgil hecanre acquailrted with Maecenas holere Horace was, aad
nor-ace (Sat. L 5, and ov 55, etet was introduced to Maecenas hy Vir-
gill Tlris introduction was plobably in the year B. c. μὴ hut, since
the nanie of Maecenas is notrnentioned in the Ezlogues oi Virgil, we
nray perhaps conclude that it was not until aiter tlrey were written
that the poet was on those iutirnate terrns with Maecenas which
ripened into sriendship. Horace, in one oi his Satires (sat. 1. 5)» in
which he tlesorihes the Journey from Rome to Brundusium, naenv
tions Virgil as one os the party, and in language which shows that
rhey were thcn in the closest intirnacy. Tho tirne tr> which this

The rnost finisherl worla os Virgil, his Georgica, au agricultural
