THE GEORGICS. Boou II.

THE main subject of the Second Book is the culture of trees,
especially the vinev But there is no great regular-icy iu the mode
ostreatment. Vlrgil opcns with un cmnnei-ntion osihe different ways
ofprcpeguting rrees, natural and nrtisrcial, so as to give some notion
os the nmgnitntlc os the iheum thcn shows how art ean impr-ove
upon nature, and recurs again io ihc mnuisolduess os his subject,
dwelling especially ou thc inuumcrablc varieties os vines Without
much relevitncy he tants οἱ the trees which are iudigcnous to different
countrics. and thence digresses into a eulogy os Italy, which he does
not sit with uny praclicnl application. Thc question ol nie entiturles
os various soils is treated fter more,widely than (he subject os the
hook requires, ciiihi-ocing the choicc ot coni and pnsture land, us
well cs of ground sor planting vines und other trees, For the next
1⁶0 lines the poet seems to he thinking exclusively os the vine,'or ol·
the trees plentcd in tlte arbustum as its snppolters. He does not
distinguish between the different modes of rearing the vine, but in
general appears to assume that the mamam will be the means
adopted, He speaks os the vine end its suppurters almost inditlerv
clttly, as objects more or less ns the same culture, so that, while
kccplng llic formet prominently hercle hlrn, he seels himselsat liberty
to use gencrul lungunge, or even to confine his language to the letter,
as metricul convenience or poetical variety may suggest, a manner
ot speaking which i-enclers this pnrt ol the hook peculial-ly difficult.
The olive, which wes- put prominently sorwarol in the nrogramme os
the hook. is actually disposed of in n very (ew lines, as requiring
hardly any culture ut all, while thc other fruitetrees are dismissed
even more briessye The remaining trees receive every hasty recem?
mendation eo [he cultivator, baeked however wikh an assurin-me that
they are even more uselul to mun than the vinev In the celebrated
digression which concludes the book, the lnhoiious aspect ns n
country lise, elsewhere so prominent, is stndlously kept out ol sight,
and we henr only ofecse, enjuyment, nnd plenty,

The beauties os this book have always been admired. and deserv>
edly so. Tlicy are most conspicuous in the digressions; but the
more strictly dirlnetic pan contains lnnnmerable seliclties os expres
sion, though it inny bc doubted whether in general they do not ohe
scure the practical meaning us much as they illustrate it.
