THE AENEID. Boot< Ι.

Tim subject os the Aeneid, as pioponntied in the opening lines, is
ihe settiemenr of Aeneas in itniy, oster yesi-s of wnndering, anri η
short hut sharp finni srrnggiei 1t is, however, only oi the events pre-
eeding the setdement ihtn the poet really treats, —oi the wnniiei-ings
and the wer. Accordingly, tho poem divides itseii intn two parts,
the wsnderiogs being einhroeeti hy the first, rhe Irniien wer hythe
second. Ent the two pai-is naturaiiyinvnive diiierent mnries os trente
ment, eomprehenoing as thoy (ιο periods os time widely differing in
1ength,the one seven years, the other apparently n few days. Here
the poet fouens ihe eimmpie ns Homer in the Odyssey. The long
period of wnnricrings is zaken et s point not ser from its coneinsion ;
enough is toiri in detail to serve as s specimen of the whoie, anri the
hero is made to narrete the rest os his past aehenrnres te the persnn
whose relation ro him is nii the iimo forming one noventnre mere.
