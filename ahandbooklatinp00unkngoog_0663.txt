652 THE Lib-13 οἳ uomet„

Horace reached horne, oniy to find his paterna! acres confismed.
His lise was spared, out nothing was iett him to sustain it but hia pen
and his good spirits. He had to write scr bread (Et 11. a„ 50 soih),
and in so doing he appeared to have acquired not oniy considerable
repnte, hut aiso sufficient rneans to purchnse the place os scribe in the
Quaestors office, a sort ος sineeure eierhship of the Treasury, which
he continued to hoid sor rnany years, isnot, indeed, to the ciose os his
lise. It was upon his return to Rome that he nrade the acquaintance
os Virgii and Varius, who were already famous, and ιο thern he was
indebted for his introductien zo Maecenas. The particulars os his
first inoerwiew with hie patron he has hin-seis recorded (s. 1. ε. 55
[ouh The acquaintance tapidiy ripened into mutual esteenr. It se-
cured the position os the poet in society, anci the generosity ofthe
statesrnan placed hini above the anxietiee osa literary lise. Through»
out the intirnate intercourse of thirty years which ensued there was
no trace os condescension on the one hand, nor es servility un the
other. Maecenas gave the poet a place next his heare⁴ He must
have respected the inan who never used his influence te ehtain those
savors which were at the disposai os the emperors minister, who
cherished nn honest pride ῐιι his own statiumznd who could be grate-
sui without being obsequiousr Horace is never weary os ackuowiedg-
ing how rnuch he cwes to his friend When he praises hirn, itis withe
out flattery. When he sooches his anxieties or cairus his fears, his
words hrearhe an uninistahabie sincerity. When he resiste his pa.
tron¹s wishes, he is hrrn without being ungracious When he spons
with his soibies, he is hrnihar without the slightcst shade os impero·-
neuce.

By Maecenas noraee was introduced to Octavius, probably soon
aster the period just referred to. [n A. Ur e. 717, a year nster Horace
had been admitted into the circle oi his friends, Maecenas wcnr to
Brundisinrny charged by Octavius ιο negotiare a ηοω with Marcus
Antonius< On this juurney he was accornpanied by Horace, who has
left a graphic record os its incidente is. 1, 5>r lt is probabie that
onthis occasion, or· about this tinae, the poet was brought to the no-
tice of the surore emneron Between the cirne os diis Journey and A.
υ. ct 722, Horace, who had in the nican time given ιο the world rnany
of his poenis, including che ten Satires of thefirst book, received ‹rorn
Maecenas the gift os che Sabine farrn, which at once ahorded hirn a
competence, and an thc plcasurcs os a country lise. The gin was a
slight ene sor Maecenas to bestow, but hc no doubt made it as the fit-
test and must welcome which he could osser to his friend. The sarm
was situated in the vaney os Usticav about twelve rniies froin Tibur
(moxi), and, arnong its other char-ns, possessed the vaiuabie aurae
